          The following section does not contain a comprehensive description of

          were modified slightly to account for different Android requirements.

      <p class="flow-text">
        Over the course of the project, the architecture of TrojaNow evolved.
        This is a result of the mapping problem between the original architecture
        and the Android SDK. Modifications were made so that mapping would be
        easier and more intuitive.</p>
        
      <h4>Reduction of Functionality</h4>

      <p class="flow-text">
        Due to the time-constraints on the project, not all of the original
        functionality was able to be implemented. Below is a list of the
        components their current implmentations.</p>
      
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col s12 m4">
          <h5>Client & Server</h5>
          <ul class="collection">
            <li class="collection-item">Sign Up</li>
            <li class="collection-item">Log In</li>

          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col s12 m4">        
          <h5>Server Only</h5>
          <ul class="collection">

          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col s12 m4">
          <h5>No Support</h5>
          <ul class="collection">
            <li class="collection-item">Creating Reports</li>

      </div>
        
      <h4>Login</h4>
      <p class="flow-text">
        Login functionality was originally expected to be provided using OAuth 2.0
        through Google+ and Facebook logins. Unfortunately, this functionality
        proved to be to time-consuming to be implemented for the project. As a
        result users are able to authenticate with their own username and password.
        Transaction-Level authentication takes place through the use of
        token-based authentication.</p>
        
      <h4>Anonymous Posts</h4>
      <p class="flow-text">
        Anonymous posts were originally slated to be marked as anonymous as part
        of the post model. Instead, anonymous posts are now assigned to a special
        user. This allows posts to be anonymous even from the server.</p>
      
      <h4>Static Managers</h4>
      <p class="flow-text">
        Android screens are dividided into activities and fragments. Passing
        data between these screens can be complicated. In order to save time on
        development, the different <em>managers</em> in TrojaNow were converted
        for static use. This was acheived by creating a constant in each of the
        managers and hiding the constructors.</p>
        
      <h4>Account Manager</h4>
      <p class="flow-text">
        The initial intention in the architecture was to store the current user
        in the authentication manager. During implementation, the storage of the
        user was moved to the Android Account Manager. This allows the account to
        be displayed in the Android Settings application.</p>
         
    
    <h2 class="header">Implementation Details</h2>
      <p class="flow-text">
        In order to account for the custom functionality in TrojaNow, a custom
        server was written. This server was written in Rails. The following
        commands are necessary to start the server.</p>

<pre>
<span># Reset the database</span>
rake db:drop
rake db:create
rake db:migrate

<span># Start the Server</span>
rails s
</pre>

      <p class="flow-text">
        Development was performed on a small test server. To run the Android app,
        you will need to recompile the application with the appropriate server.
        To do this, change the setting specified below.</p>

<pre>
<span>// us.grahn.trojanow.logic.Utilities.java</span>
private static final String SERVER = "http://[YOUR SERVER IP]:3000/";
</pre>
    
    <h2 class="header">Style</h2>
      <p class="flow-text">
        One of the primary reasons for choosing the Android SDK was the ability to
        conform with Google's <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html">Material Design</a>.
        This allows for advanced animations in the GUI with minimal effort. Frameworks
        built on-top of the SDK aren't able to take advantage of Android 5.0+'s
        special handling of animations.</p>
      
      <p class="flow-text">
        Choosing this approach allows the application to blend-in with the system
        applications with which the user is familiar. This cuts down on the
        learning-curve.</p>
    
    <h2 class="header">Lessons</h2>

      <h4>Mapping is Hard!</h4>
        <p class="flow-text">
          One of the hardest parts of this project was conforming to the original
          architecture. Due to constraints placed upon interactions by Android, it
          simply wasn't possible at certain spots.</p>
      
      <h4>Keep the Target in Mind</h4>
        <p class="flow-text">
          If your intended target already has support for a particular architecture,
          think long and hard before differing form that architecture. Working
          against a target is much harder than working with it.</p>
          
        <p class="flow-text">
          If I were to redo the TrojaNow architecture, I would make modifications
          so that the application could map more directly to the Android SDK. This
          would allow for faster coding with less hassle.</p>

      <h4>Don't Live in an Ivory Tower</h4>
        <p class="flow-text">
          If an architect isn't doing development, they need to frequently hear
          the feedback of the developers. As the architect of my project, it
          hurt every time I had to change the architecture. At the same time, I
          was occassionally frustrated by limitations of the architecture and
          conflicts with the target.</p>
          
        <p class="flow-text">
          Being aware of these conflicts allowed me to make executive decisions
          about how and where to change the architecture. If another target is
          added, I would recommend creating a modified architecture for the new
          target. Most parts of the architecture would stay the same, but some
          may have to change.</p>
